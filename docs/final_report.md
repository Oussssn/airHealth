## Introduction

As a student interested in public health and data science, I developed the airHealth package to provide accessible tools for analyzing air quality data and its health impacts. This project represents my first major R package development, combining environmental health analysis with practical programming skills. The package aims to simplify the complex process of air quality assessment and health impact analysis, making these important tools more accessible to researchers and public health professionals.

## Package Features

### Core Functionality

1. Air Quality Analysis
   - EPA's Air Quality Index calculation with standard breakpoints
   - Multiple pollutant analysis (PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2)
   - Clear air quality categorization and health advisories
   - Support for both hourly and daily measurements

2. Health Impact Assessment
   - Health effects evaluation based on WHO guidelines
   - Short-term risk analysis for vulnerable populations
   - Respiratory health impact estimation
   - Population-level health burden calculation

3. Visualization Tools
   - Time series plots with trend analysis
   - Health impact visualization with risk levels
   - Risk trend analysis with warning thresholds
   - Correlation heatmaps for pollutant relationships
   - Customizable plot themes and color schemes

## Conclusion

The airHealth package provides a solid foundation for air quality analysis and health impact assessment. While it's my first R package, it demonstrates practical application of programming skills to public health challenges. The development process taught valuable lessons about package development, documentation, and user experience. The package successfully balances technical accuracy with user accessibility, making it a useful tool for both researchers and public health professionals.

This project was developed as part of the SWE005 - Multivariate Statistical Analysis with R course, demonstrating the practical application of statistical methods and R programming in environmental health analysis.
